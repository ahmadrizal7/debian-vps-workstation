# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file
- Use configurator/constants.py for project-wide constants

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood
- Use domain-specific terminology when appropriate

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split
- Classes should have a single, well-defined purpose

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth
- Use utility modules for common operations

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions
- Follow the project's module organization pattern

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions
- Use private methods (leading underscore) for internal logic

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it
- Run ruff and mypy before committing

## Testing
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names
- Follow the project's git workflow
